# OX Game

[Project Site](https://nickmro-tic-tac-toe.firebaseapp.com/)

## Overview

This version of OX was produced as my first AngularJs project for Web Development. It was built using AngularJS and Firebase.

It functions like any other game of Tic Tac Toe, but using AngularJS and Firebase, it allows two players to play a game with the same view from two different computers.

At the conclusion of any given game, players have the option to view past game boards to get further insight into their opponent's moves.

## How It Was Made

This project utilizes [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to dynamically synchronize the views of multiple users. This is made possible by [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), an API that enables realtime data updating for all application users.

## How To Use

The game can be played [here](http://www.raiiiar.com/ox/).

Click "Start Game" to play a match. After the match is complete, look at past game boards to gain insight on your opponent's strategies or continue to play another game.

Enter your name by clicking below the "X" or "O" on either the left or right side.
